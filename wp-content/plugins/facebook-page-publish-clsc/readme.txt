"Facebook Page Publish" publishes your blog posts to your Facebook profile or page.

== Description ==

"Facebook Page Publish" publishes your blog posts to the wall of your Facebook profile, page or application. Posts appear on the wall of your choice as if you would share a link (there is NO "published via Application" notification). The authors [gravatar](http://gravatar.com), a self-choosen or random post image, the title, author, categories and a short excerpt of your post can be shown.

Decide yourself when and what posts to publish. Supports local and remote publishing based e.g. on the post category.

Makes use of the modern Facebook graph-API and integrates easily into your WordPress Blog.

All you need to do is (see *Installation*):

* Create a [Facebook application](https://www.facebook.com/developers/createapp.php)

Technical features:

* 100% userfriendly, easy to install & remove
* Lightweight, clean code

== Installation ==

Bob from http://wpvideo.tv made a nice [Installation Video How-To](http://wpvideo.tv/wordpress-blog-posts-auto-feed-facebook-fan-page/wordpress/682/)!

1. Install the plugin from your wordpress admin panel.

OR

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

Done? Then go to the plugin's settings page and follow the detailed setup instructions.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I publish to multiple walls, pages or profiles? =
Not possible. See [Facebook Platform Policies](https://developers.facebook.com/policy), IV:

    IV. Application Integration Points
    5. You must not provide users with the option to publish more than one Stream story at a time.

This also makes a great excuse for not having had the time to implement such functionality.

= How can I publish to a group? =
Also not possible, at least not the expected way without additional "published via Application XY" notice.

= I can't activate the plugin because of fatal errors! =
This plugin requires php5. Sometimes you have to add 
`AddType x-mapp-php5 .php
AddHandler x-mapp-php5 .php`
to your .htaccess file.

= I got an error: Your authorization code was invalid or expired =
This happens from time to time. Give Facebook some time, they will fix it shortly.

= I have an other question / idea for improvement / observed a bug! =
Please post your question in the [forum](http://wordpress.org/tags/facebook-page-publish), I will try to reply shortly.
